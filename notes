Recursion:

*) has descending and ascending phase compared to loop having ascending phase

Time complexity:

Depends on N so O(n)

Types of Recursion:
1.Tail Recursion -  takes up O(n) space compared to it's alternative loops which takes up O(1) space
2.Head Recursion - Recursive function call is set at first in the same recursive function
3.Tree Recursion - Multiple recursive function calls within the function is Tree Recursion
4.Indirect Recursion - two  recursive functions specified within each other is a Indirect recursion
5.Nested Recursion - fun(fun(n+11));

memoization is storing the  repitative results in an array for recursive

tower of hanoi is a inorder traversal

To find the element in a memory(Mapping) for a two dimensional array of size A[m][n] = L0+[j*m+i]+w; //Row Major Formula
L0+[j*n+j]+w //column major Formula

Lower Triangular Matrix - 
Row Major Matrix formula: Index A[i][j])=[i(i-1)/2]+j-1;
column Major Matrix formula: Index A[i][j]=[n(j-1)-(j-2)(j-1)/2]+(i-j);
