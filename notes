abstract Datatypes

list:

add(element)/append(element)
add(index, element)/insert(index, element)
remove(index)
set(index,element)/Replace(index, element)
get(index)
search(key)


Recursion:

*) has descending and ascending phase compared to loop having ascending phase

Time complexity:

Depends on N so O(n)

Types of Recursion:
1.Tail Recursion -  takes up O(n) space compared to it's alternative loops which takes up O(1) space
2.Head Recursion
3.Tree Recursion
4.Indirect Recursion
5.Nested Recursion
